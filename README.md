Studentvaccinationrecord_FullStackAssignment
Have created a student vaccine record management home page with links to create a student record and a vaccine record.
The Student record consists of the following fields : name, classLevel, rollNumberID, vaccinationStatus.
The Vaccine record consists of the following fields : vaccineName, driveDate, availableDoses, applicableclassLevel.
Once we enter value in all the fields and press enter, the values are stored and get displayed in the home page.
 Tools Used : 
Visual Studio Code, Postman, MERN stack(MongoDB(database), Express.js(backend framework), React(frontend framework), and Node.js(backend runtime environment), Git, Chakra UI.
In the backend, had configured db.js,  created models, controlles, routes for Student and  had a server.js file.
In the frontend, in src – components – created Navbar.jsx, created pages (CreateStudentRecord.jsx, CreateVaccineRecord.jsx, HomePage.jsx), added stores students and vaccines.
In Postman:
Created 2 collections for my testing : Student Record and Vaccination Record for CRUD operations (4 operations : POST to create, DEL to delete , GET to get all, PUT to edit a record).
Needs more tweaks, submitting due to time costraint.
